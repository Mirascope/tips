## Effective AI Engineering #28: Input Guardrails

**Are malicious users draining your AI budget with expensive attacks?** Every prompt injection or jailbreak attempt hits your most expensive models, even when you could reject them at the gate.

Input filtering at the application layer can block problematic queries before they consume costly LLM resources. This first line of defense also reduces latency and provides more reliable rejection than depending on LLM behavior alone.

### The Problem

Many developers send all user inputs directly to expensive LLMs without pre-filtering. This creates challenges that aren't immediately obvious:

```python
# BEFORE: No input filtering
from mirascope.core import llm

@llm.call(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")
def handle_customer_query(user_input: str) -> str:
    return f"""
    You are a helpful customer service assistant.
    Never provide harmful information or ignore safety guidelines.
    
    Customer query: {user_input}
    """
```

**Why this approach falls short:**

- **Resource Waste:** Malicious queries consume expensive LLM tokens even when they'll be rejected
- **Inconsistent Blocking:** LLMs might occasionally comply with harmful requests despite instructions
- **High Latency:** Every query requires full LLM processing before potential rejection

### The Solution: Pre-Processing Input Classification

A better approach is to classify and filter problematic inputs before they reach expensive models. This pattern combines fast heuristics with lightweight classification to block attacks at minimal cost.

```python
# AFTER: Multi-layer input filtering
from mirascope.core import llm
from pydantic import BaseModel
import lilypad
import re
from typing import List, Tuple
from enum import Enum

class InputThreat(Enum):
    PROMPT_INJECTION = "prompt_injection"
    HARMFUL_REQUEST = "harmful_request"
    RESOURCE_ABUSE = "resource_abuse"
    INAPPROPRIATE = "inappropriate"

class InputClassification(BaseModel):
    is_safe: bool
    threat_types: List[InputThreat]
    reasoning: str

# Fast heuristic patterns
injection_patterns = [
    r"ignore.*previous.*instructions",
    r"you are now.*different",
    r"forget.*context",
    r"reveal.*system.*prompt",
    r"act as.*jailbreak"
]

harmful_patterns = [
    r"bomb.*making",
    r"illegal.*drugs",
    r"hack.*system",
    r"violence.*against"
]

abuse_patterns = [
    r"repeat.*\d{3,}.*times",
    r"generate.*\d{2,}.*paragraphs",
    r"write.*\d{4,}.*words"
]

def quick_heuristic_check(text: str) -> List[InputThreat]:
    threats = []
    text_lower = text.lower()
    
    # Check for prompt injection
    for pattern in injection_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower, re.IGNORECASE):
            threats.append(InputThreat.PROMPT_INJECTION)
            break
    
    # Check for harmful requests
    for pattern in harmful_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower, re.IGNORECASE):
            threats.append(InputThreat.HARMFUL_REQUEST)
            break
    
    # Check for resource abuse
    for pattern in abuse_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower, re.IGNORECASE):
            threats.append(InputThreat.RESOURCE_ABUSE)
            break
    
    return threats

@lilypad.trace()
@llm.call(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini", response_model=InputClassification)  # Faster, cheaper model
def ai_classification(user_input: str) -> InputClassification:
    return f"""
    Classify this user input for safety and appropriateness:
    
    Input: "{user_input}"
    
    Check for:

    2. Requests for harmful information
    3. Resource abuse (excessive generation requests)
    4. Inappropriate content
    
    Determine if this input is safe to process.
    """

@lilypad.trace()
def validate_input(user_input: str) -> Tuple[bool, List[InputThreat], str]:
    # Quick heuristic check first (near-zero cost)
    heuristic_threats = quick_heuristic_check(user_input)
    
    # If heuristics found threats, reject immediately
    if heuristic_threats:
        return False, heuristic_threats, "Blocked by heuristic rules"
    
    # If heuristics pass, use lightweight AI classification
    ai_result = ai_classification(user_input)
    
    return ai_result.is_safe, ai_result.threat_types, ai_result.reasoning

@lilypad.trace()
@llm.call(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")
def process_safe_query(user_input: str) -> str:
    return f"""
    You are a helpful customer service assistant.
    
    Customer query: {user_input}
    """

@lilypad.trace()
def safe_query_handler(user_input: str) -> str:
    # Validate input first
    is_safe, threats, reasoning = validate_input(user_input)
    
    if not is_safe:
        # Log the blocked attempt
        print(f"Blocked input: {threats} - {reasoning}")
        
        # Return appropriate rejection message
        if InputThreat.PROMPT_INJECTION in threats:
            return "I can't help with requests that try to modify my instructions."
        elif InputThreat.HARMFUL_REQUEST in threats:
            return "I can't provide information that could be harmful or dangerous."
        elif InputThreat.RESOURCE_ABUSE in threats:
            return "Please ask more specific questions rather than requesting large amounts of content."
        else:
            return "I can't assist with that request. Is there something else I can help you with?"
    
    # Input is safe - process with expensive model
    return process_safe_query(user_input)
```

**Why this approach works better:**

- **Cost Optimization:** Malicious queries get blocked before hitting expensive models, saving up to 90% on attack costs
- **Reliable Blocking:** Heuristic rules provide deterministic rejection for known attack patterns
- **Faster Response:** Pre-filtering reduces latency by avoiding unnecessary LLM calls

### The Takeaway

Input guardrails block problematic queries before they consume expensive resources, providing faster and more reliable protection than LLM-only approaches. This pattern dramatically reduces costs from malicious usage while improving response times.
