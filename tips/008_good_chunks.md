## Effective AI Engineering #8: Create Semantically Focused Chunks for RAG

**Are you getting poor relevance from your RAG system?** Your chunking strategy could be sabotaging your retrieval quality, even with the best embeddings and models.

Raw documents, especially long ones, often make terrible retrieval units. When chunks are too large, too small, or arbitrarily split, your RAG system struggles to find the right information. This directly impacts answer quality and user experience.

### The Problem

Many developers implement RAG using simplistic chunking approaches that prioritize convenience over quality:

```python
# BEFORE: Naive Fixed-Size Chunking
documents = load_documents("knowledge_base/")
chunks = []

for doc in documents:
    # Arbitrary splitting every 1000 characters
    text = doc.text
    for i in range(0, len(text), 1000):
        chunks.append(text[i:i+1000])

# Index these fixed-size chunks
index_chunks(chunks)
```

**Why this approach falls short:**

- **Diluted Relevance:** Long chunks contain multiple topics, making it hard for retrievers to match user queries with the specific relevant sections.
- **Context Fragmentation:** Fixed-size splitting often cuts mid-sentence or breaks logical units, destroying semantic coherence and context.
- **Lost Information:** When chunks are too small, the answer to a question might be split across multiple fragments that aren't retrieved together.
- **Wasted Context Budget:** Large, undifferentiated chunks waste valuable context window space with irrelevant information.
- **Low Information Chunks:** Naive splitting often produces useless chunks with navigation elements, whitespace, or partial information.

### The Solution: Semantic-Aware Chunking

A better approach is to create cohesive, topic-focused chunks that respect natural document boundaries. This ensures each retrieval unit contains complete, self-contained information.

```python
# AFTER: Document-Aware Chunking with Metadata
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, Any, List

class EnrichedChunk(BaseModel):
    content: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)

def create_semantic_chunks(document: str, doc_id: str) -> List[EnrichedChunk]:
    # Use document structure to guide splits
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=500,
        chunk_overlap=50,
        separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", ", ", " ", ""],  # Prioritize natural breaks
    )
    
    raw_chunks = text_splitter.split_text(document)
    chunks = []
    
    for i, text in enumerate(raw_chunks):
        # Enrich with metadata to improve retrieval
        metadata = {
            "source_id": doc_id,
            "chunk_index": i,
            # Add semantic metadata to improve matching
            "hypothetical_questions": generate_questions_for_chunk(text),
            "summary": summarize_chunk(text),
            "keywords": extract_keywords(text)
        }
        chunks.append(EnrichedChunk(content=text, metadata=metadata))
    
    return chunks
```

**Why this approach works better:**

- **Improved Relevance:** Chunks align with semantic boundaries, preserving logical units of information that better match user queries.
- **Context Preservation:** Natural splitting respects document structure, keeping related information together.
- **Enhanced Retrieval:** Metadata like questions, summaries, and keywords bridges the vocabulary gap between queries and documents.
- **Context Efficiency:** Right-sized chunks use context window space more efficiently, allowing more relevant information to be included.
- **Better RAG Performance:** Semantic chunking directly improves answer quality by ensuring retrievers can find complete, focused information.

### The Takeaway

Effective RAG requires semantically meaningful chunks, not arbitrary text fragments. By implementing document-aware chunking strategies and enriching chunks with metadata, you'll dramatically improve retrieval quality and maximize the value of your knowledge base.
