## Effective AI Engineering #36: Human Approval for Risky Tools

**Did your AI agent just delete your production database?** Tool-enabled AI can execute powerful actions, but without proper guardrails, one hallucination or misinterpretation can cause irreversible damage.

AI agents with tool access can perform incredibly useful automation, but they lack human judgment about risk and context. A simple file cleanup task could become data loss if the AI misunderstands scope or encounters unexpected edge cases.

### The Problem

Many developers give AI agents direct access to powerful tools without human oversight. This creates challenges that aren't immediately obvious:

```python
# BEFORE: Unrestricted tool access
from mirascope.core import llm
import lilypad
import os
import subprocess
from typing import List

@llm.call(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")
def ai_system_agent(user_request: str) -> str:
    return f"""
    You have access to these system tools:
    - file_delete(path): Delete files or directories
    - run_command(cmd): Execute shell commands
    - database_query(sql): Run SQL queries
    
    User request: {user_request}
    
    Use the appropriate tools to complete this task.
    """

def file_delete(path: str) -> str:
    """Delete files - no safety checks"""
    try:
        if os.path.isdir(path):
            os.rmdir(path)
        else:
            os.remove(path)
        return f"Deleted: {path}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"

def run_command(cmd: str) -> str:
    """Execute shell commands - dangerous without limits"""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
        return f"Output: {result.stdout}\nError: {result.stderr}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"

def database_query(sql: str) -> str:
    """Execute SQL - could be destructive"""
    # Simulated database operation
    return f"Would execute: {sql}"

# AI has unrestricted access to dangerous operations
user_requests = [
    "Clean up old files in /tmp",
    "Free up disk space",
    "Remove unused data",
    "Optimize the database"
]

for request in user_requests:
    # No human oversight - AI could misinterpret and cause damage
    response = ai_system_agent(request)
    print(f"AI Response: {response}")
```

**Why this approach falls short:**

- **No Risk Assessment:** AI can't distinguish between safe operations and potentially destructive ones
- **Context Blindness:** Lacks understanding of business impact, data importance, or operational timing
- **Irreversible Actions:** Once executed, destructive operations can't be undone

### The Solution: Risk-Based Human Approval Gates

A better approach is to classify tool operations by risk level and require human approval for dangerous actions. This pattern maintains AI efficiency for safe operations while protecting against catastrophic mistakes.

**Why this approach works better:**

- **Risk-Proportionate Control:** Low-risk operations execute immediately while dangerous ones require approval
- **Human Context:** Operators can consider business impact, timing, and circumstances AI cannot evaluate
- **Audit Trail:** All high-risk operations have documented human approval for compliance

### The Takeaway

Human approval gates for risky tool operations prevent AI agents from causing irreversible damage while maintaining automation efficiency for safe tasks. This pattern balances AI capability with human oversight where it matters most.
