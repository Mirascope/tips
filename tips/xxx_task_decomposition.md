## Effective AI Engineering Tip #xxx: Break Complex Tasks into Evaluable Components

**Trying to solve everything in one LLM call?** Complex tasks with multiple requirements and varied success criteria often fail or produce inconsistent results when handled as monolithic prompts.

LLMs struggle with complex, multi-faceted tasks due to competing objectives, broad success criteria, and the cognitive load of handling multiple concerns simultaneously. This leads to higher variance in outputs, reduced reliability, and difficulty in identifying where failures occur in the reasoning chain.

### The Problem

Many developers approach complex tasks by cramming everything into a single, comprehensive prompt:

```python
# BEFORE: Monolithic Complex Task
@llm.call(provider='openai', model='gpt-4o')
@prompt_template("""
Analyze this customer support ticket and:
1. Extract the customer's main issue and sentiment
2. Categorize the issue type (technical, billing, feature request, etc.)
3. Determine urgency level (low, medium, high, critical)
4. Generate a personalized response addressing their concerns
5. Suggest internal follow-up actions for the support team
6. Update the customer's profile with relevant tags

Ticket: {ticket_text}
Customer History: {customer_history}

Return as JSON with all fields filled out.
""")
def process_support_ticket(ticket_text: str, customer_history: str): ...

# Usage
result = process_support_ticket(ticket, history)
# What if categorization is wrong but response is good?
# How do you evaluate each component individually?
# Where did it fail if the output is partially correct?
```

**Why this approach falls short:**

- **Poor Evaluation Granularity:** When the LLM gets sentiment right but categorization wrong, you can't measure individual component performance or identify specific failure points.
- **Conflicting Objectives:** Generating empathetic responses while maintaining factual accuracy creates competing priorities that reduce overall quality.
- **High Variance:** Complex tasks have too many "acceptable" paths to completion, leading to inconsistent outputs and unpredictable behavior.
- **Difficult Debugging:** When something goes wrong, it's nearly impossible to identify which specific component failed or needs improvement.

### The Solution: Task Decomposition (Prompt Chaining)

A better approach is to break complex tasks into focused, individually evaluable components. This technique, also called "prompt chaining," creates a pipeline where each step has a clear, measurable objective and feeds structured output to the next component.

```python
# AFTER: Decomposed Task with Individual Components

# Component 1: Issue Analysis
@llm.call(provider='openai', model='gpt-4o-mini')
@prompt_template("""
Analyze this support ticket and extract:
1. Main issue (one clear sentence)
2. Customer sentiment (positive, neutral, negative, frustrated)
3. Issue category (technical, billing, feature_request, account, other)
4. Urgency level (low, medium, high, critical)

Ticket: {ticket_text}
""")
def analyze_ticket(ticket_text: str) -> TicketAnalysis: ...

# Component 2: Response Generation
@llm.call(provider='openai', model='gpt-4o')
@prompt_template("""
Generate a personalized customer support response for this issue.
Issue: {issue}
Sentiment: {sentiment}
Customer History: {customer_history}
""")
def generate_response(issue: str, sentiment: str, customer_history: str) -> str: ...

# Component 3: Internal Actions & Tags
@llm.call(provider='openai', model='gpt-4o-mini')
@prompt_template("""
Generate follow-up actions and profile tags.
Issue: {issue}, Category: {category}, Urgency: {urgency}

1. Suggest 2-3 internal follow-up actions
2. Recommend customer profile tags to add
""")
def generate_actions_and_tags(issue: str, category: str, urgency: str) -> ActionsAndTags: ...

# Orchestrating function - same end result as BEFORE
def process_support_ticket(ticket_text: str, customer_history: str):
    analysis = analyze_ticket(ticket_text)
    response = generate_response(analysis.issue, analysis.sentiment, customer_history)
    actions_tags = generate_actions_and_tags(analysis.issue, analysis.category, analysis.urgency)
    
    return TicketResult(
        issue=analysis.issue,
        sentiment=analysis.sentiment,
        category=analysis.category,
        urgency=analysis.urgency,
        response=response,
        followup_actions=actions_tags.actions,
        profile_tags=actions_tags.tags
    )
```

**Why this approach works better:**

- **Individual Evaluation:** Each component can be tested and measured separately. Poor categorization doesn't mask good response generation, allowing targeted improvements.
- **Focused Objectives:** Each LLM call has a single, clear purpose, reducing conflicting requirements and improving consistency within each component.
- **Model Optimization:** Use faster, cheaper models (gpt-4o-mini) for structured analysis tasks and reserve powerful models (gpt-4o) for creative response generation.
- **Easier Debugging:** When issues arise, you can pinpoint exactly which component failed and iterate on just that piece without affecting the entire system.

### The Takeaway

Don't try to solve complex, multi-objective tasks in a single LLM call. Task decomposition through prompt chaining creates more reliable, evaluable, and maintainable AI systems. Each focused component can be individually optimized, tested, and improved, leading to better overall performance and easier debugging when things go wrong.
