## Introducing "Effective AI": Practical Tips for Building Better AI Systems

There's an incredible amount of energy pouring into building AI-powered systems right now, and a lot of talented people are joining the effort, many coming from more traditional software engineering backgrounds. That's fantastic news! Your experience building robust, scalable, and maintainable software is invaluable. Honestly, strong engineering fundamentals probably get you 80% of the way there when building many AI applications.

However, working directly with AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces some unique wrinkles. Things like non-determinism, heavy data dependency, new types of failure modes (hallucinations!), and distinct security concerns require adapting some existing practices and adopting some new ones.

We've noticed that the most effective teams building in this space tend to converge on similar patterns and techniques. Many of these will likely feel familiar – perhaps analogous to principles like dependency injection, clear interfaces, or robust testing from traditional software engineering. That's often how it should feel; good engineering principles are often universal, just applied differently.

Yet, despite the rapid progress, there isn't really a single, coherent guide outlining these emerging "best practices" for applied AI development. It feels like everyone is reinventing the wheel or learning things the hard way through trial and error.

That's where this series, "Effective AI," comes in.

Inspired by classics like "Effective C++" or "Effective Python," our goal is to provide a series of practical, actionable tips to help you navigate the specifics of building reliable, secure, and performant AI systems more quickly.

Here's what you can expect:

- Digestible Tips: Each post will focus on a single, mostly self-contained piece of advice – something you can read quickly and think about applying to your own work.
- Focus on Practice: We'll emphasize how to implement these ideas.
- Battle Tested: Each principle comes from decades of experience building real world AI systems across many company sizes (Google, LinkedIn, startups) and industries (consumer, enterprise, healthcare, finance)
- Universally Applicable Principles: The core advice in each tip should be framework and library agnostic. The underlying principles matter most.
- Concrete Examples: However, to make the advice tangible, our code examples will primarily feature tools like mirascope (for interacting with LLMs) and lilypad (for instrumentation/tracing). This is simply because they're what we're most familiar with and use day-to-day. You should be able to adapt the patterns shown to your preferred toolkit.
- Broad Scope: We'll cover topics across the development lifecycle, touching on reliability, security, performance, evaluation, development velocity, and more.

Our hope is that, taken together, these tips will provide a practical roadmap, allowing you to incrementally adopt better practices and avoid common pitfalls. Whether you're integrating your first LLM call or scaling a complex agentic system, we think you'll find value here.

We're excited to share what we've learned (and are still learning!).

Let's build effective AI, together.
