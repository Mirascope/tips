## Effective AI Engineering: Structure Your Outputs for Reliable Systems

**Are your LLM integrations fragile and difficult to maintain?** Raw text from LLMs becomes a maintenance nightmare when it needs to feed into other parts of your software.

When LLM outputs need to update databases, call APIs, or populate UIs, treating them as raw text creates brittle systems. Without proper structure, even slight variations in the model's response format can break your application, leading to constant patching and reliability issues.

### The Problem

Many developers retrieve natural language responses and then write separate code to parse them using string manipulation, regex, or complex conditional logic:

```python
# BEFORE: Parsing Raw Text Downstream
raw_llm_output = llm.generate("Summarize the meeting and list action items.")
# raw_llm_output might be:
# """The meeting was about Project Phoenix. Key decisions were X and Y.
# Action Items:
# - John Doe to update slides by Friday.
# - Jane Smith to schedule follow-up."""

# Fragile downstream parsing logic:
summary = raw_llm_output.split("Action Items:")[0].strip()
action_items_text = raw_llm_output.split("Action Items:")[1]
items = []
for line in action_items_text.strip().split('\n'):
    if line.startswith('-'):
        # ... complex logic to extract task, assignee, due date ...
        # What if the format changes slightly? This breaks!
        ...
```

**Why this approach falls short:**

- **Brittle Integrations:** The slightest change in the LLM's output phrasing, formatting, or capitalization breaks your downstream parsing logic, leading to constant maintenance headaches.
- **Difficult Validation:** Reliably checking if extracted data (like dates or emails) is valid requires complex validation logic *after* fragile parsing.
- **Hard to Extend:** Adding features like Chain-of-Thought reasoning or extracting more nuanced data requires complicating both the prompt *and* the brittle parsing code.
- **Inconsistent Handling:** Parsing and validation logic often gets scattered across different parts of your application.

### The Solution: Design for Structure Upfront

A better approach is to define the *structure* you need using a schema (like a Pydantic model) and use tools that help the LLM conform to it. This makes the interaction predictable and robust.

```python
# AFTER: Structured Output with Schema Validation
from mirascope import llm, prompt_template
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, EmailStr
from datetime import datetime


SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
SYSTEM: You are an expert in summarizing meetings.

USER: Please summarize the following meeting notes and extract action items: {meeting_notes}
"""

# 1. Define the desired output structure WITH validation
class ActionItem(BaseModel):
    task: str = Field(..., description="The specific action item description.")
    assignee_email: EmailStr = Field(..., description="The email address of the assignee.")
    due_date: datetime | None = Field(None, description="Optional due date (YYYY-MM-DD).")


class StructuredMeetingSummary(BaseModel):
    reasoning: str | None = Field(None, description="Step-by-step thinking process.")
    summary: str = Field(description="A concise summary of the meeting.")
    action_items: list[ActionItem] = Field(description="A list of all action items.")

# The structured function with enforced output format
@llm.call(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini", response_model=StructuredMeetingSummary)
@prompt_template(SUMMARY_PROMPT)
def get_structured_summary(meeting_notes: str): ...

notes = "Project is overall on track. skylar@gmail.com needs to email requirements to Jeff for review."
# Usage is now simple and reliable
result = get_structured_summary(meeting_notes=notes)
print(f"Task: {result.action_items[0].task}, Assignee: {result.action_items[0].assignee_email}")
```

**Why this approach works better:**

- **Reliable Integration:** Your application code interacts with predictable Python objects, not fragile text, allowing clean data access (e.g., `result.action_items[0].assignee_email`).
- **Built-in Validation:** Data schemas with validation rules (like `EmailStr` or custom validators) ensure you're working with valid data immediately after parsing.
- **Easier Extensibility:** Need Chain-of-Thought? Add a `reasoning` field to the model and adjust the prompt. Downstream code accessing structured data remains unchanged.
- **Parsing Flexibility:** Frameworks like Mirascope abstract how the structure is enforced (tool calling, JSON mode), insulating your code from LLM implementation details.

### The Takeaway

Stop treating LLMs like mere text generators when their output needs to integrate with code. Define structured outputs using schemas and leverage frameworks that help LLMs conform to those structures. This approach makes your AI integrations more robust, easier to validate, and simpler to extend as your application evolves.
