## Effective AI Engineering #23: Self-Consistency Prompting

**Is your AI giving different answers to the same question?** One moment it's 'Option A,' the next 'Option C'. Leaving you wondering what to trust (and if stakeholders noticed).

For software engineers in early-stage startups, pushing AI to production feels like a high-stakes gamble. You've fought to get a feature out. But then your AI starts behaving unpredictably. That gut-wrenching feeling hits: _is this going to break everything?_ You're not alone. The unpredictable nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) means even identical prompts can yield wildly different results.  This isn't just an annoyance; for critical decisions like customer support, financial analysis, or safety checks, this variability can quickly erode user trust and derail your entire AI project

### The Problem

Many teams, especially when moving fast, rely on a simple approach: a single call to the LLM and accepting whatever answer comes back. It feels efficient, but it creates hidden risks that only surface when things go wrong:

```python
# BEFORE: Single call approach
from mirascope.core import llm
from pydantic import BaseModel

class DiagnosisResult(BaseModel):
    diagnosis: str
    reasoning: str

@llm.call(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini", response_model=DiagnosisResult)
def diagnose_symptom(symptom: str) -> DiagnosisResult:
    return f"""
    Analyze this patient symptom: {symptom}
    Choose the most likely diagnosis from: A) Common Cold, B) Flu, C) Allergies
    """

# Single call - no consistency check
result = diagnose_symptom("runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes")
```

**Why this approach falls short:**

- **Unreliable Outputs:** Same symptoms might get different diagnoses on different runs
- **No Confidence Measure:** Single responses provide no indication of answer reliability
- **Hidden Uncertainty:** The model's internal uncertainty isn't surfaced to make informed decisions

This isn't just about code; it's about the hours you'll waste debugging "black box" behavior, the stress of unexpected outages, and the worry that your AI project might join the 87% that never make it to production.

### Reclaim Control: The Power of Self-Consistency

Imagine shipping AI features with confidence, knowing you've built in a reliability check that surfaces uncertainty before it impacts users. That's the power of self-consistency validation.

Instead of relying on a single guess, this method generates multiple responses in parallel. By comparing these outputs, you can pick the most consistent answer and even get a "confidence score" based on how much the model agrees with itself. Itâ€™s like having a built-in second (or fifth) opinion, making your AI outputs far more robust.

```python
# AFTER: Self-consistency with parallel generation
from mirascope.core import llm
from pydantic import BaseModel
import lilypad
from collections import Counter
from typing import List
import asyncio

class DiagnosisResult(BaseModel):
    diagnosis: str
    reasoning: str

class ConsistencyResult(BaseModel):
    final_answer: str
    is_reliable: bool
    all_responses: List[str]
    reasoning: str

@lilypad.trace()
@llm.call(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini", response_model=DiagnosisResult)
async def diagnose_symptom_single(symptom: str) -> DiagnosisResult:
    return f"""
    Analyze this patient symptom: {symptom}
    Choose the most likely diagnosis from: A) Common Cold, B) Flu, C) Allergies
    """

@lilypad.trace()
async def diagnose_with_consistency(symptom: str, num_samples: int = 5) -> ConsistencyResult:
    # Generate multiple responses in parallel
    tasks = [diagnose_symptom_single(symptom) for _ in range(num_samples)]
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Extract diagnoses and count frequency
    diagnoses = [r.diagnosis for r in responses]
    diagnosis_counts = Counter(diagnoses)
    
    # Get most common answer
    most_common_diagnosis, frequency = diagnosis_counts.most_common(1)[0]
    agreement_score = frequency / num_samples
    
    # Aggregate reasoning from responses with the winning diagnosis
    winning_responses = [r for r in responses if r.diagnosis == most_common_diagnosis]
    combined_reasoning = "; ".join([r.reasoning for r in winning_responses[:2]])
    
    return ConsistencyResult(
        final_answer=most_common_diagnosis,
        is_reliable=agreement_score >= 0.6,
        all_responses=diagnoses,
        reasoning=f"Consensus: {combined_reasoning}"
    )

# Usage with reliability check
@lilypad.trace()
async def reliable_diagnosis(symptom: str) -> str:
    result = await diagnose_with_consistency(symptom)
    
    if result.is_reliable:
        return result.final_answer
    else:
        return f"Uncertain - responses varied: {result.all_responses}"
```

Why this approach makes you look smart:

- Reliability Measurement: You get immediate agreement scores, clearly showing when your model is confident enough for a critical decision and when it needs human oversight. 
- Consistent Outputs: By choosing the most frequent response, you drastically reduce the impact of those frustrating outlier generations, ensuring your users get a stable experience.
- Transparent Uncertainty: When agreement is low, you know precisely when to flag an output for review, preventing embarrassing errors and building user trust.

### Build AI That Just Works

Self-consistency prompting isn't just a technical tweak; it's a fundamental shift that empowers you to build AI systems you can trust. It transforms "hidden uncertainty" into "actionable insight," allowing you to distinguish between reliable consensus and outputs that demand a closer look.

Stop firefighting unexpected AI behavior and start building AI that earns trust. This pattern is a key step towards making your AI reliable and understandable.
