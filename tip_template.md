## Effective AI Engineering #[Tip Number]: [Tip Title]

**Are you struggling with [specific problem]?** [One sentence description of pain point that resonates with engineers]

[2-3 sentences expanding on the problem and its impact on AI applications. Be specific about why this matters.]

### The Problem

Many developers approach this by [describe common approach]. This creates challenges that aren't immediately obvious:

```python
# BEFORE: [Brief label describing the problematic pattern]
[Problematic code example]
```

**Why this approach falls short:**

- **[Issue Category 1]:** [Explain specific problem with this approach]
- **[Issue Category 2]:** [Explain specific problem with this approach]
- **[Issue Category 3]:** [Explain specific problem with this approach]
- **[Issue Category 4]:** [Optional additional issue]

### The Solution: [Name of Pattern/Approach]

A better approach is to [1-2 sentences introducing the solution]. This [pattern/technique/approach] [explain how it addresses the core issues].

```python
# AFTER: [Brief label describing the improved pattern]
[Improved code example]
```

**Why this approach works better:**

- **[Benefit 1]:** [Explain specific improvement]
- **[Benefit 2]:** [Explain specific improvement]
- **[Benefit 3]:** [Explain specific improvement]
- **[Benefit 4]:** [Optional additional benefit]

### The Takeaway

[1-2 sentence summary of the core principle]. This [approach/pattern] makes your AI-powered applications more [robust/maintainable/reliable/etc.] and addresses [reiterate key pain point from introduction].
